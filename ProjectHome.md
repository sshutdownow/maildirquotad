**maildirquotad** is used together with [exim](http://exim.org) for checking the quotas of a mailboxes at **RCPT TO** time: **exim** has no builtin facility for checking the quotas of a mailbox at **RCPT TO** time, in situation when you have many **MX** servers and only one **mailhub** that stores mail data it became a real problem. Say, **MX** server has received mail, but **mailhub** defers it because recipient's mailbox is full. But **MX** already has said to remote server that mail had been successfully delivered.
